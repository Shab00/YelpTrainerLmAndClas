# YelpTrainerLmAndClas
A Jupyter Notebook for creating a language model and performing classification on the Yelp dataset using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

Yelp NLP Trainer and Classifier
This repository contains the yelptrainerlmandclas.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, which is designed to create a language model and perform classification on the Yelp dataset using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
The yelptrainerlmandclas.ipynb notebook includes the following features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Utilizes libraries such as pandas and numpy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses visualization libraries to explore and understand the dataset.
Language Model Creation: Implements a language model using the fastai library.
Text Classification: Performs text classification on the Yelp dataset to predict categories or sentiments.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the models using various metrics.

Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
fastbook
fastai
